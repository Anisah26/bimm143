# Section 1

```{r}
db<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
Xray.tot <-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
EM.tot <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$EM)))
NMR.tot <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$NMR)))


```

Hmm.. I am doing the same thing over and over. Time to write a function.

```{r}
#I will work with 'x' as input
sum_comma <- function(x) {
    # Substitute the comma and convert ot numeric
    sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}

```

For Xray:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma((db$Total)), 3)
```

85.5% are Xrays

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma((db$Total)), 3)
```

7.5% are EMs

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1])/ sum_comma(db$Total),3)
```

86.8% of structures in PBD are protein

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED! (It appears that there are 2064 HIV-1 protease structures in the current PBD.)

# Section 2

Using Molstar

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to hee Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend "Ball & Stick" for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# Section 3

## Working with Structures in R

We can reAD THE `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDb structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

There are 198 amino acid residues.

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

Two of the non-protein residues are HOH(127) and MK1(1)

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

There are 2 protein chains in this structure.

```{r}

```

## Predicting Functional Motions

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called the NMA (Normal MOde Analysis)
```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a "movie"(a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in Molstar
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
